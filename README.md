# Implementation of Binary-Blocking Flow Algorithm by Goldberg and Rao

Hello! Welcome to our implementation of the binary blocking flow algorithm by Goldberg and Rao. This 
implementation was done using the `networkX` python library. It contains the same API as the `dinitz` 
max flow algorithm in `NetworkX`.  

## Installation

First create a python environment suitable for the repository. This repo requires `python3` to run the code. 

Once this is done, run the following command: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the packages necessary to run the programs. 

## Running The Program

In order to test the program, simply run ``main.py`` and if the tests pass, then the algorithm is correct.
